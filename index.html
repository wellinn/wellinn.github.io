    <p>Hi everyone, my name is William Quinonez. I'm currently looking code in order to further my career and knowlegde in this field.      A little bit about myself, i'm recently married over a year ago (happy wife, happy life).
        I'm traveler for business and pleasure. Career wise, I work in the Health Insurance field as a Sales Consultant, so I'm able to meet all walks of life. For pleasure, my wife and I tend to travel locally and abroad to experience different cultures. My general interest consist of world history and american pop culture.
    </p>
